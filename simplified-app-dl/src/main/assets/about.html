	<p>
		This app is built by Datalogics based on the SimplyE reader from The New York Public Library's free e-reader app.  The purpose of this app is to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology outside of NYPL’s environment.  The app, as is built, has all the features supported by the SimplyE reader, except that the content source is limited to Open Access content hosted by the New York Public Library, and the sampling of content hosted by Datalogics’ Adobe Content Server.  As the app demonstrates, this technology can be deployed to libraries or businesses who wish to adopt a similar business model as implemented by The New York Public Library.
